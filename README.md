# Operating-Systems

This repository contains my work on the xv6 operating system, which is a re-implementation of Unix Version 6 (v6), developed for teaching operating systems concepts at MIT.

## Project Overview

This project is based on xv6, a teaching operating system developed at MIT. The xv6 operating system is a modern reimplementation of Sixth Edition Unix (V6) in ANSI C for multiprocessor x86 systems.

## Repository Structure

- `xv6-labs-2024/`: Contains the main xv6 operating system code and lab implementations

## Getting Started

To build and run xv6, you'll need:

- RISC-V toolchain
- QEMU emulator
- Make build system

## Building and Running

Detailed instructions for building and running the system can be found in the xv6-labs-2024 directory.

## License

This project follows the same licensing as the original xv6 project from MIT.
